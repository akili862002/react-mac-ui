Customers residing in Brazil have the right to cancel and return their order within 7 days, for any reason.</li><li><strong>Who May Use This Warranty?</strong>  Printful extends the Limited Warranty only to Users and Merchants.  All Limited Warranty coverage terminates if the User or the Merchant’s Customer sells or otherwise transfers a Product.</li><li><strong>What Does This Warranty Not Cover?</strong>  This Limited Warranty does not cover any damage to or defect in a Product caused by any of the following: (a) you or third parties; (b) any improper handling (including during shipping), use or storage of the Product; (c) any failure to follow any Product instructions; (d) any modifications to the Product; (e) any unauthorized repair to the Product; or (f) any external causes such as accidents, fire, flood, “acts of God” or other actions or events beyond our reasonable control; or (g) any costs or expenses related to the loss of use of the Product or any other costs or expenses not covered by this Limited Warranty.  This Limited Warranty does not cover any items supplied by third parties, size exchanges or buyer’s remorse.</li></ol><p>Finally, as noted elsewhere in this Agreement, we unfortunately cannot guarantee that the colors and details in our website images are 100% accurate representations of a Product, and sizes might in some cases be approximate.  Accordingly, this Limited Warranty does not cover such matters.</p><ol><li><strong>What Is The Period Of Coverage?</strong>  This limited warranty starts on the date of the delivery of the Product to the User or the Merchant’s Customer and lasts for thirty (30) days (the “Warranty Period”). For the avoidance of doubt, Printful acknowledges that according to some jurisdictions the User may be entitled to a longer Warranty Period.</li><li><strong>What Are Your Remedies Under This Warranty?</strong>  With respect to any materially defective or damaged Product, we will, in our sole discretion, either: (a) replace such Product (or the defective or damaged part of the Product) free of charge, or (b) refund the purchase price paid to us by the User or the Merchant along with the shipping fees corresponding to the defective or damaged Products.</li><li><strong>How Do You Obtain Warranty Service?</strong>  Promptly following delivery of a Product, you or your Customer (if you are a Merchant) will inspect the Product.  If a Product is materially defective (including any error by Printful in printing) or damaged upon receipt, or if you received the wrong Product, then in order to be eligible for service under this Limited Warranty, you must submit a claim within the Warranty Period in compliance with our <a href="https://www.printful.com/policies/returns" target="_self">Return Policy</a>.  If you are a Merchant, your Customer should contact you regarding any defective or damaged Product and with respect to any delivery of the wrong Product.</li><li><strong>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</strong>  THE REMEDIES DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION 6 ARE YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES (AND OUR ENTIRE LIABILITY) FOR ANY BREACH OF THIS LIMITED WARRANTY.

THIS LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS, WHICH VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. WE LIMIT THE DURATION AND REMEDIES OF ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO OUR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TO THE DURATION OF THE WARRANTY PERIOD.
